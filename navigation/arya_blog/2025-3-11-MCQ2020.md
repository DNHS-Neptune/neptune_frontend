# MCQ Reflection:

After observing the Content and Skills Performance, areas I need improvement are
- 3.6: Conditionals
- 5.2: Digital Divide
- 1.4: Identifying and Correcting Errors

For 3.6 conditionals, I wasn't able to apply my knowledge of conditionals to the question, I plan on strengthening my knowledge and possibly watching a youtube video on it. For 5.2, I didnt understand what the digital divide was. After researching, I learned that the digital divide is essentially the gulf between people who have access to internet, and people who do not. Lastly, for 1.4, I got a majority of the questions right in that topic with the exception of a problem involving a procedure with if else statements. I believe this was simply reading the answer choices wrong, as I was able to rework this problem and get it right.

# Question 58: AnyPairs Procedure

The correct answer is C. My Choice (A) is incorrect because the procedure incorrectly returns false when no two values are the same, which is expected. However, in C ("bat", "cat", "bat"), the procedure incorrectly returns false instead of true because it only checks (x = y) first and ignores (x = z) when (x â‰  y).

# Question 43:(Redundant routing on network configuration): 

The correct answer is C (Both configurations I and II). My choice (A) is incorrect because both configurations provide multiple paths between Q and V, allowing for redundancy in routing.

# Question 11: Color represented by binary triplet:

The correct answer is A (Ivory). My choice (D) is incorrect because the binary RGB triplet (11111111, 11111111, 11110000) converts to (255, 255, 240), which corresponds to Ivory, not Vivid Yellow

# Question 5: Inputs to Logic Circuit

My answer is wrong because I miscalculated the additions and subtractions of even and odd numbers. The correct answer is B (-2) because the procedure adds even numbers (8 and 2) and subtracts odd numbers (3 and 9), resulting in -2 as the answer.
